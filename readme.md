settings can edit your own data by filling out the form and clicking the edit button. The next functionality of an authorized user is to share an image with or without title, and
by choosing whether to share it with everyone or just in your gallery. The user can share the text

There is a poll that the user can only fill once and give his rating on the site. On the other side of site there is a complete admin panel, which allows
the admin to create, read, update, and delete (as an acronym CRUD). Also he can see survey statistics, user activities and much more...
